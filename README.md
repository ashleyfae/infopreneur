# Infopreneur

A business theme for infopreneurs. Still a work in progress. Seriously. Don't look.

Demo site (WIP): https://demo.nosegraze.com/infopreneur/

## Supported Plugins

* [Easy Digital Downloads](https://wordpress.org/plugins/easy-digital-downloads/)
* [Expanding Archives](https://wordpress.org/plugins/expanding-archives/)
* [MailChimp for WordPress](https://wordpress.org/plugins/mailchimp-for-wp/)
* [Naked Social Widget](https://github.com/nosegraze/naked-social-widget)
* [WP Instagram Widget](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-instagram-widget/)

## Todo:

* Figure out sidebar situation. I have settings for two (left/right) but only actually have one sidebar (right) created.
* Style lists
* Check forms (primarily dropdowns).
* Test all core widgets.
* Do something cool with category widget.
* Jetpack integration.
* NG About Author integration.
* Naked Social Share integration.
* Naked Social Widget integration.
* WooCommerce integration - if I can be bothered. Maybe it's stupid to add this and EDD.
* Easy Digital Downloads integration. (Almost done but tweak checkout form, maybe featured download on archive)
* Better sub-menu design
* Run unit test.

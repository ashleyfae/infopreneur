# Infopreneur

A business theme for infopreneurs. Still a work in progress. Seriously. Don't look.

Demo site (WIP): https://demo.nosegraze.com/infopreneur/

## Todo:

* Figure out sidebar situation. I have settings for two (left/right) but only actually have one sidebar (right) created.
* Lists
* Test all core widgets.
* Jetpack integration.
* Expanding Archives integration.
* NG About Author integration.
* Naked Social Share integration.
* Naked Social Widget integration.
* WooCommerce integration - if I can be bothered. Maybe it's stupid to add this and EDD.
* Easy Digital Downloads integration. (Almost done but tweak checkout form, etc.)
* Better sub-menu design
* Option to stick menu.
